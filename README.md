**Data Project Questions & Considerations**  

**![][image2]PACE: Plan Stage**

**Foundations of data science** 

* Who is your audience for this project?   
* What are you trying to solve or accomplish? And, what do you anticipate the impact of this work will be on the larger business need?   
* What questions need to be asked or answered?  
* What resources are required to complete this project?   
* What are the deliverables that will need to be created over the course of this project?

**Get Started with Python**

* How can you best prepare to understand and organize the provided information?  
* What follow-along and self-review codebooks will help you perform this work?  
* What are a couple additional activities a resourceful learner would perform before starting to code?

**Go Beyond the Numbers: Translate Data into Insights**

* What are the data columns and variables and which ones are most relevant to your deliverable?  
* What units are your variables in?  
* What are your initial presumptions about the data that can inform your EDA, knowing you will need to confirm or deny with your future findings?  
* Is there any missing or incomplete data?   
* Are all pieces of this dataset in the same format?  
* Which EDA practices will be required to begin this project?

**The Power of Statistics**

* What is the main purpose of this project?    
* What is your research question for this project?  
* What is the importance of random sampling? In this case, what is an example of sampling bias that might occur if you didn’t use random sampling?

**Regression Analysis: Simplify Complex Data Relationships**

* Who are your stakeholders for this project?  
* What are you trying to solve or accomplish?  
* What are your initial observations when you explore the data?  
* What resources do you find yourself using as you complete this stage? (Make sure to include the links.)  
* Do you have any ethical considerations in this stage?

**The Nuts and Bolts of Machine Learning**

* What am I trying to solve?  
* What resources do you find yourself using as you complete this stage?   
* Is my data reliable?  
* Do you have any additional ethical considerations in this stage?  
* What data do I need/would I like to see in a perfect world to answer this question?  
* What data do I have/can I get?  
* What metric should I use to evaluate success of my business objective? Why?

**Data Project Questions & Considerations**  

**![][image3]PACE: Analyze Stage**

**Get Started with Python**

* Will the available information be sufficient to achieve the goal based on your intuition and the analysis of the variables?

**Go Beyond the Numbers: Translate Data into Insights**

* What steps need to be taken to perform EDA in the most effective way to achieve the project goal?

* Do you need to add more data using the EDA practice of joining? What type of structuring needs to be done to this dataset, such as filtering, sorting, etc.?

* What initial assumptions do you have about the types of visualizations that might best be suited for the intended audience?

**The Power of Statistics**

* Why are descriptive statistics useful?  
* What is the difference between the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis?

**Regression Analysis: Simplify Complex Data Relationships**

* What are some purposes of EDA before constructing a multiple linear regression model?  
* Do you have any ethical considerations in this stage?

**The Nuts and Bolts of Machine Learning**

* What am I trying to solve? Does it still work? Does the plan need revising?  
* Does the data break the assumptions of the model? Is that ok, or unacceptable?  
* Why did you select the X variables you did?  
* What are some purposes of EDA before constructing a model?  
* What has the EDA told you?  
* What resources do you find yourself using as you complete this stage?  
* Do you have any ethical considerations in this stage?

**Data Project Questions & Considerations**  

**![][image4]PACE: Construct Stage**

**Get Started with Python**

* Do any data variables averages look unusual?  
* How many vendors, organizations or groupings are included in this total data?

**Go Beyond the Numbers: Translate Data into Insights**

* What data visualizations, machine learning algorithms, or other data outputs will need to be built in order to complete the project goals?   
* What processes need to be performed in order to build the necessary data visualizations?   
* Which variables are most applicable for the visualizations in this data project?   
* Going back to the Plan stage, how do you plan to deal with the missing data (if any)?

**The Power of Statistics**

* How did you formulate your null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis?  
* What conclusion can be drawn from the hypothesis test? 

**Regression Analysis: Simplify Complex Data Relationships**

* Do you notice anything odd?  
* Can you improve it? Is there anything you would change about the model?

**The Nuts and Bolts of Machine Learning**

* Is there a problem? Can it be fixed? If so, how?  
* Which independent variables did you choose for the model, and why?  
* How well does your model fit the data? (What is my model’s validation score?)  
* Can you improve it? Is there anything you would change about the model?  
* Do you have any ethical considerations in this stage?
